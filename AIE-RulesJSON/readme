The script needs be run from the PM component and requires an active logon session to the WebUI.  

### Parameters
* $userId = 1.  LogRhythmAdmin = 1, if not using LR admin then change user ID accordingly.
* $aieStartRuleNo = 1.  AIE rules start from ID 1, unless after specific rules leave as is. 
* $aieStopRuleNo = 1200.  AIE rules currently go up to 1200 ish, so again can leave as is unless lots more rules get added.
